          Many inexpensive printers do not have the function of printing in text mode, only in graphical so-called GDI printers). Older DOS programs designed to print in text mode dot matrix printers. It should note that most printers do not support national languages.<br><br>
	  The DOSprn program can solve the problem.

          DOSPRN will be the real savior of your old DOS programs. These days, many laser and inkjet printers have powerful features but cannot print plain text with formatting precision. In addition, some inexpensive printers cannot print in text mode at all.<br><br>
	  The DOSPRN program will allow you to use old DOS programs with new printers, regardless of their type. For example, USB and network printers, print servers, and PDF printers.

          We haven't come across any worthy tool that competes with DOSPRN, which makes it a must-have piece of software for people who use the DOS environment for their work or hobby. The simplicity and backward compatibility that it offers are enough to help you get started on any Windows system.<br /><br />
          However, for comparison's sake, we did test it against the likes of DosPrint and Printfil. Neither could match the simplicity and lightness of DOSPRN, which is perhaps its biggest highlight. Those of us who use DOS software today like the simplicity and raw power of such tools.

          The problem with modern printers, no matter if they are inkjet or laser, is that they cannot print simple text accurately. This feature may be desired by some DOS users, who still use some applications which run only in the DOS environment. Often it's the case when these DOS applications are not compatible with regular Windows printers.<br /><br />
	  In this situation, the user should try to save and export the text from the DOS application into a regular TXT file, which can take a lot of time and may produce unsatisfying results.<br /><br />
          But when installing the DOSPRN application, things become easier. That's because DOSPRN acts like a bridge between old DOS applications and modern Windows printers, allowing the user to print directly from these applications and get very good results. ...&quot;

&quot;Thank you for keeping DOS alive.<br><br>

We are using DOSPRN to print from a DOS program running on Windows XP in the year 2022. Our parallel printer stopped working and we needed a solution to print to a modern USB printer.<br><br>
DOSPRN to the rescue!<br><br>
Well worth the price of the single license and way better than trying to find a working parallel printer on ebay/craigslist.<br><br>
I think you have the longest trial period on the Internet. I was just informed of the watermark printing on documents (what seems like months after installing).<br><br>
So happy to support your efforts.&quot;</p>

          <td><i>Brian Smither &lt;bsmither&#64;sacpcug.org&gt;</i><p>&quot;Here's the problem: inexpensive printers are as brain-dead as are their compatriot win-modems. I mean to say, these win-printers rely on the printer drivers to render the hardcopy. The drivers (simply speaking) drive the inkjet nozzles directly instead of sending character codes and escape sequences - a printer control language like Epson's ESC/P2 command set.</p>
<p>And that's a problem for those who still use DOS-based applications. Windows applications use a process that involves things called GDI and WMF (sometimes RAW). These things are beyond the scope of this article but suffice it to say that in Windows 2000 and XP, DOS-based applications are not afforded the GDI process. In many cases, the application's output is run through the second half of the system but is unceremoniously ignored and as a result, nothing happens.</p>
<p>The solution, as best as one gets until a specific printer driver exists that makes the following process seamless, is to convince the DOS-based application to send its output to a file. Or, if that cannot be done, then redirect the LPT's output to a file. Or, if that cannot be done, capture the output destined for the port to a file. Once the application's output (from now on, called the &quot;text stream&quot;) has been written to a file, another program can take that file and process it just as if you were using Notepad to load and print that text stream.</p>
<p>DOSprn is one such utility that does this. It is constantly looking for the presence of a specific file in a specific folder and, once it shows up, the utility interprets the embedded font control commands, translating that into the GDI process, and then sending the document to the win-printer. As mentioned before, DOSprn is one of several utilities that solve this problem - DOSprn was evaluated because it seemed to do what I needed it to do (and nothing more) and was the least expensive of the bunch. (And was perceived to be the simplest in its operation, perceived to be the least obnoxious in its evaluation mode, and/or perceived to be the least pernicious when uninstalling.)....&quot;</p>

All other actions will be&nbsp;carried out by&nbsp;the program itself.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;decently stays in&nbsp;the tray area, automatically captures all text-mode output and directs it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the printer you selected. DOSprn easily operates with any modern printer, even with network and USB ones, and even with print-server and PDF printers. It&nbsp;correctly interprets most of&nbsp;the special text-mode sequences (special codes managing the text layout&nbsp;&#151; for ex. bold or&nbsp;italic style). The program allows you to&nbsp;choose any font for printing, and properly works with any DOS codepage.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The software is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;good balance between functionality (you can&#146;t&nbsp;imagine a&nbsp;thing that the program doesn&#146;t&nbsp;know about text-mode printing) and simplicity (even your secretary would learn it&nbsp;quickly) and usability.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multilanguage interface and further development of&nbsp;the program are pleasant bonuses.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you must not be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;technical progress; this software is&nbsp;always available to&nbsp;you to&nbsp;solve any backward compatibility problems.&quot;</p>

          increasingly difficult to support using modern printer hardware, and 
          Win XP makes life difficult too for DOS. To transfer everything to a 
          newer program would be both expensive and very time consuming...<br>

          I already have, which appears as a printer. DOSPRN works perfectly 
          with this, and has given my old DOS program a new &quot;lease of life&quot;. It

          the computer or printer.&nbsp; I now have access to many possibilities of 
          formatting my documents, but most of all, I will be able to continue 
          access to all my years of work.&nbsp; I am very grateful, and I really
